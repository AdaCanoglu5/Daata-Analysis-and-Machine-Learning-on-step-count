# Data-science-project-on-my-daily-step-count
In this project I have analyzed the data of the number of steps I took everyday in the last 5 years, using Apple's Health app to collect and extract the data. I have used machine learning models to try to predict future step counts based on the data.

You can find a short video below 5 minutes, explaining the project briefly. The slides from video are also provided which gives an overall explanation of the whole project.
